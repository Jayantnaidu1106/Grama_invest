        <h2>What are Futures and Options?</h2>
        <p>Futures and options are the primary types of derivatives trading in the stock market. These contracts are agreements between two parties to trade an asset at a predetermined price on a specified future date. They help hedge risks by locking in prices beforehand.</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Futures and options derive their prices from an underlying asset such as stocks, indices, commodities, or ETFs.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Difference between Futures and Options</h2>
        <p>While both futures and options serve as hedging tools, they have distinct differences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Futures:</strong> Mandates the buyer/seller to execute the contract at the agreed-upon price on the expiration date.</li>
            <li><strong>Options:</strong> Gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to execute the trade if it is profitable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Futures and Options</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Put Options:</strong> Allows the holder to sell an asset at a predetermined price.</li>
            <li><strong>Call Options:</strong> Enables the holder to buy an asset at a fixed price in the future.</li>
            <li><strong>Future Contracts:</strong> A binding contract that requires the buying or selling of an underlying asset at a predetermined price and date.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Who Should Invest?</h2>
        <h3>1. Hedgers</h3>
        <p>Hedgers aim to secure their future gains or minimize losses by locking in prices through derivatives contracts. For instance:</p>
        <div class="info-box">
            <p>A farmer can sell 50 kg of potatoes for Rs. 20/kg via a futures contract. This guarantees his income even if market prices drop. In case of a price increase, he might miss out on higher profits.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>2. Speculators</h3>
        <p>Speculators analyze market trends to profit from price fluctuations. For example:</p>
        <div class="info-box">
            <p>An investor expecting prices to rise buys a stock now to sell later at a higher price. Conversely, they might short a stock if they anticipate a price drop.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>3. Arbitrageurs</h3>
        <p>Arbitrageurs exploit price differences between different markets or instruments. They take advantage of inefficiencies in the pricing of derivatives to generate profits. For example:</p>
        <div class="info-box">
            <p>If a futures contract is priced lower than the spot price in one market and higher in another, arbitrageurs can buy low in one market and sell high in another.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Settlement Methods</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical Settlement:</strong> Actual delivery of the underlying asset upon contract maturity.</li>
            <li><strong>Cash Settlement:</strong> Payment of the price difference between the contract price and the market price, without physical delivery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Risks and Benefits of Futures and Options</h2>
        <h3>Benefits:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hedge against market fluctuations:</strong> Futures and options allow investors to lock in prices and protect against price volatility.</li>
            <li><strong>Leverage:</strong> Futures contracts allow investors to control large amounts of an asset with a small initial margin.</li>
            <li><strong>Diversification:</strong> These contracts provide access to different asset classes, such as commodities and foreign exchange, enabling portfolio diversification.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Risks:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Losses:</strong> If the market moves against the investor's position, they can face substantial losses.</li>
            <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Futures and options can be difficult to understand for beginner traders and require in-depth market knowledge.</li>
            <li><strong>Margin Calls:</strong> Futures traders may be required to add more funds to their margin account if their positions go against them.</li>
        </ul>
