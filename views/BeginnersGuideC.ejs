            <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
            <p>A cryptocurrency is a virtual or digital currency that can be used to buy goods and services. There is no physical coin or bill involved, as all transactions take place online. It uses an online ledger with strong cryptography to ensure secure transactions.</p>
            <p>Cryptocurrency is purely virtual and functions as a decentralized medium of exchange. It relies on cryptography to verify and facilitate each transaction, and blockchain technology underpins it. Blockchain is a shared public ledger that ensures all transactions are transparent and secure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>How was the Idea of Cryptocurrency Conceived?</h2>
            <p>The concept of digital currency gained traction during the 90s tech boom. Many organizations attempted to create a digital currency out of central authority control, but most ventures failed due to fraud or lack of decentralized systems.</p>
            <p>This changed in 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. Bitcoin revolutionized digital currency by using blockchain technology to enable decentralized and secure transactions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>How Does Cryptocurrency Work?</h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrency works as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, where there is no central authority involved. Transactions include public keys (wallet addresses) of both sender and receiver, along with the transaction amount.</p>
            <p>Miners verify these transactions by solving cryptographic puzzles. Upon verification, transactions are recorded in the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability. Miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency for their efforts.</p>
